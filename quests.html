Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to embark on a scavenger hunt adventure around Reed College. You will need to find and collect items hidden at various locations around campus. Your first clue will lead you to the next location, and so on, until you've completed the entire quest.
Clue 1: Reed Library Your first stop is the Reed Library, where you will find a clue hidden on the third floor. Look for a book titled "The Hunt" and turn to page 42. There you will find your first clue.
Clue 2: Reed Rugby Field Head over to the Reed Rugby Field, where you will find your next clue hidden behind one of the goalposts. Look for a small plastic container with a red lid.
Clue 3: The Island in the Canyon Your final destination is the Island in the Canyon, where you will find the dragon's treasure chest containing the final item you need to collect. To get there, follow the path that leads from the Rugby Field down into the canyon. Once you reach the Island, look for a large rock with a hole in it. Reach inside the hole and you will find the treasure chest.
Inside the treasure chest, you will find a piece of paper with a final message. This message will lead you to the final location where you will receive a special surprise. 
Good luck on your adventure!
